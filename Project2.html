            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project is to utilize SQL queries to data extraction and transformation, along with Power BI for interactive data visualization, 
                to gain comprehensive insights into how memberships are distributed across various facilities and the patterns of facility usage over time.
                The data is gathered from the membership database, booking records, and facility information.

            <h2>Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL)</h2>
            <p>
                The initial phase of the project focuses on data extraction from various databases, followed by data cleaning 
                and preparation using SQL queries. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are then applied 
                to gain insights into membership patterns, facility bookings, and usage behavior.

                Subsequently, data transformation tasks, including data aggregation, table joins, creation of calculated fields, and derivation of meaningful metrics. 
                These data preparation steps will lay the foundation for a consolidated and analyzable dataset.

                To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories, the following tables were extracted using SQL: Booking, Facilities, and Members tables.
            </p>
                To enhance the visual representation of findings, Power BI is used to create interactive 
                dashboards and reports. Visualizations include line charts showing usage trends over time, and
                bar charts highlighting the most popular bookings per facilities,displaying the distribution 
                of the membership and guest costs.

            <h2>Dashbord</h2>
            <p>
                The data analysis revealed interesting trends, such as total number of slots booked in each in each facility 
                and the popularity of specific facilities during certain months. These findings 
                have led to more targeted marketing strategies and optimized staff scheduling.
                The Power BI dashboards have proven to be effective tools for data visualization and 
                decision-making, allowing stakeholders to explore data interactively and gain deeper 
                insights into facility usage patterns.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates the power of SQL and data visualization tools like Power BI 
                in analyzing complex datasets and providing actionable insights. By understanding 
                membership and usage patterns, the health club can better serve its members, optimize facility operations, and enhance the overall user experience.
